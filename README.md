# DSA - Data Structures and Algorithms

This is a personal laboratory for implementing data structures and algorithms in different programming languages.

## 🎯 Objective

To serve as a playground for studying, implementing, and comparing classic data structures and algorithms, exploring the particularities of each language.

## 🚀 Implemented Languages

- **JavaScript** - Implementations focusing on modern ES6+ syntax
- **Python** - Leveraging the simplicity and readability of the language
- **Ruby** - Exploring the expressiveness and elegance of Ruby

## 🛠️ How to Run

Each language has its own Docker configuration:

### JavaScript
```bash
cd javascript_dsa
docker-compose up
```

### Python
```bash
cd python_dsa
docker-compose up
```

### Ruby
```bash
cd ruby_dsa
docker-compose up
```

## 📚 Implemented Data Structures and Algorithms

### Lists
- **Singly Linked List** - Simple linked list
- **Doubly Linked List** - Doubly linked list

### Trees
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)** - Binary search tree

### Search Algorithms
- **Binary Search** - Binary search

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort** - Bubble sort
- **Selection Sort** - Selection sort

### Heaps
- **Max Heap** - Maximum heap

## 🔬 Development Environment

Each language runs in its own Docker container, providing:
- Dependency isolation
- Environment consistency
- Easy test execution

## 📝 Testing

All implementations have unit tests to ensure the correctness of the implemented algorithms.

## 🎯 Next Steps

- Add more languages (Go, Rust, Java, etc.)
- Implement more data structures (Graphs, Tries, etc.)
- Add advanced sorting algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
- Time and space complexity analysis
